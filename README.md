## Project Overview
Small business founders often track **revenue**, but not **profit margin**, **cost efficiency**, or **expense structure**.  
This dashboard analyzes 6 months of operational data (May–Oct 2025) for two businesses:

- **Malvin Adire Stores**  
- **Skincare Studio**

The result is a **decision-support tool** that uncovers profitability drivers and operational inefficiencies.

---

## Problem Statement
Founders frequently misjudge profitability because they:

- Focus on sales instead of margins  
- Ignore cost-to-income ratio  
- Lack financial reporting structure  
- Do not compare business units efficiently  

This project addresses these blind spots with analytics.

Below are the **Top 5 queries** included in the README.  
The *full SQL script* is stored in:  [View financial_queries.sql](./sql/financial_queries.sql)


### 1. Monthly Revenue, Expense & Profit
```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    Business_Name,
    ROUND(SUM(Income), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(Expense), 2) AS Total_Expense,
    ROUND(SUM(Income - Expense), 2) AS Total_Profit
FROM financial_insight_data
GROUP BY FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM'), Business_Name
ORDER BY Month, Business_Name;
```

### 2. Highest Profit Month & Best Profit Margin
```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    Business_Name,
    SUM(Net_Profit) AS TotalProfit,
    ROUND(SUM(Net_Profit) * 100.0 / SUM(Income), 2) AS ProfitMargin
FROM financial_insight_data
GROUP BY FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM'), Business_Name
ORDER BY TotalProfit DESC;
```

### 3. Trend Analysis – Month-by-Month Revenue & Profit
```sql
SELECT
    FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    Business_Name,
    SUM(Income) AS TotalRevenue,

FROM financial_insight_data
GROUP BY FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM'), Business_Name
ORDER BY Month, Business_Name;
```

### 4. Month-over-Month Profit Change (MoM)
```sql
WITH MonthlyProfit AS (
    SELECT

    GROUP BY FORMAT(Date, 'yyyy-MM'), Business_Name
)
SELECT 
    Business_Name,
    Month,
    Profit,
    Profit - LAG(Profit) OVER (PARTITION BY Business_Name ORDER BY Month) AS MoM_Change
FROM MonthlyProfit;
```

### 5. Expense Breakdown by Category

SELECT
    Business_Name,
    Expense_Category,
